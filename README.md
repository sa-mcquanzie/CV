## Amelia Scott

Hello!

I'm a confident polyglot programmer, Getting Stuff Done enthusiast, and  recent graduate from [Maker's Academy](https://makers.tech/), a coding bootcamp.

I'm a career changer who previously co-founded an art project space and gallery in South London, which has given a platform to over 50 emerging and established artists since its inception.

Although I'm just starting my career in technology, I am by no means new to tech, having been coding, making, hacking and creating for most of my life, for fun and occasionally profit.

## Other interests

I still love Philosophy, which I studied for my degree, and one of my reasons for pursuing a career in technology is that it feels like just the right amount of philosophy-in-action for me.

I play a variety of instruments, mostly with strings. I find that playing and composing music is about equal to coding, in terms of sheer addictiveness, and satisfies a similar desire to get to the heart of how things function, to tinker, iterate and reinvent.

I love science fiction of both the serious and silly varieties â€” I'm a big fan of science fact, too. When I have the time to burn I'm also partial to boring, grindy simulation games.
